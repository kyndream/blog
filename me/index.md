Hello, my name is Kyndrea Martinez. Co-Founder & CTO / Full-Stack Developer at [LEZAY](https://www.lezay.com). I like music, films, podcasts, and tacos (I am a native Texan so this is mandatory and also delicious).

# What do you do?
I build stuff for the internet.

# Who are your favorite artists?
Currently I'm listening to a lot of Natalia LaFourcade and a Spotify playlist I put together of a bunch of songs from my teenage years: [adolescence backwash](https://t.co/bsFpCjPUnv).

# What languages/frameworks do you use?
I frequently use: HTML / Haml, SCSS, JavaScript / CoffeeScript, Ruby on Rails, and Ember.js
